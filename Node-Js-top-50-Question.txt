1. What is Node.js? Where can you use it?..................................................................................

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime 
environment and library to run web applications outside the 
clientâ€™s browser. It is used to create server-side web applications.

Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses
an asynchronous, event-driven model. You can use  I/O intensive
web applications like video streaming sites. You can also use 
it for developing: Real-time web applications, Network applications,
General-purpose applications, and Distributed systems.




2. Why use Node.js?..........................................................................................................
Node.js makes building scalable network programs easy. 
Some of its advantages include:

It is generally fast
It rarely blocks
It offers a unified programming language and data type
Everything is asynchronous 
It yields great concurrency




3. Why is Node.js Single-threaded?........................................................................................
Node.js is single-threaded for async processing. By doing 
async processing on a single-thread under typical web loads,
more performance and scalability can be achieved instead of 
the typical thread-based implementation.




4. If Node.js is single-threaded, then how does it handle concurrency?......................................................
The Multi-Threaded Request/Response Stateless Model is not 
followed by the Node JS Platform, and it adheres to the 
Single-Threaded Event Loop Model. The Node JS Processing 
paradigm is heavily influenced by the JavaScript Event-based 
model and the JavaScript callback system. As a result, Node.js 
can easily manage more concurrent client requests. The event loop 
is the processing model's beating heart in Node.js.
